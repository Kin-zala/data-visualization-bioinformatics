1. Visualization Exercise 1
   
Three alternative visualizations of the same artificial data shall be re-created. All three visualizations show the same fictitious genomic annotations together with fictitious RNA binding protein data. The visualizations are an example for RNA binding protein signals as well as the genomic annotations. Recreate each of the shown figures. Two different datasets are provided for this task:

10_project_data_annotations.csv

10_project_data_signals.csv

The 10_project_data_annotations.csv file contains fictitious genomic information as visualized in all bottom panels of the example plots. Each horizontal line represents a transcript. A transcript can contain multiple exons (grey rectangles). Transcripts can be located on the '+' or on the '-' strand of the DNA.

10_project_data_signals.csv contains fictitious signals of four RNA binding proteins (P1, P2, P3, P4).
